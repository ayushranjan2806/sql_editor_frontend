## ü™ú Steps I took to optimize the page load time

- Used Lighthouse DevTools Extension to find the performance issues and fix them using their actionable suggestion.
- Used vercel to deploy this website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install all the packages in package.json. This will install all the dependencies and devDependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
